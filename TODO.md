# Future developments

1. Improve code with L.tooltip and json for leaflet:  
   a. Change markers for airports;  
   b. Put interactive labels (ICAO codes) for airports;  
   c. Show legend with: Reference_Airport and Served_Airports

2. Rebuilding the functions for generic application, example:  
   a. analysisByRWY(ReferenceAirport,PCN,RWYLenght);

This study was not necessary as it is focused only on LPVZ (Viseu Airport).

3. Build/process a database with flight routes to evaluate possible connections.  
   Interesting to see the range that the reference airport can have with a simple connection.
